# This is a placeholder FBX file for testing
# In a real implementation, this would be a proper FBX binary file
# For now, this file serves to test the FBX loading detection logic
# 
# To use real FBX files:
# 1. Export a 3D model from Blender, Maya, or 3ds Max as FBX
# 2. Place the .fbx file in this directory
# 3. Update the fbxPath in PartitionScene.cpp to point to your file
# 4. Implement proper FBX parsing in Mesh::CreateFromFBX()
#
# For production use, consider integrating:
# - Assimp library (open source, supports many formats including FBX)
# - Autodesk FBX SDK (official, but requires license for commercial use)
